# Design Human-knowledge-tree in cyber context #

I am an MA Graphic Design Student.This repository is for my Graduation Design Project.I want to build a human knowledge tree in a cyber context ,which aim to provide self-learner a more holistic view to human knowledge.

Human knowledge Scope is vast and fun. People deserve to be provided a opportunity to explore more in it for digging self-potential.

This project designed as a pivot platform that is able to provide a knowledge structure to classify quality open-sourced learning sites. Everyone can upload free learning references link on this platform.

Be together, we are achieving global equality education!
